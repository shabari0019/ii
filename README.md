# Object detection and counting using SSD 

Steps:-

#step1: download ob zip file then extract it you will have 1 notebook and 2 html and one image then open notebook in colab

#step2: create 1st folder named templates in colab and add about.html and index.html which is extracted from zip

#step3: create 2nd folder named static in cold and add back.jpg which is extracted from zip

#step4: run all the code sequentially one cell after another

#step5: go to  "2ND LAST CELL"  and click on ngrok-free.app link where the webapp running which will be appear once that cell run

#step6: make sure the last cell runs continuously till you finish all operations in web.

#step7:Don't click on local host address present in last cell as i mentioned the web will in ngrok-free.app "2ND LAST CELL"

FEATURES:

⦿ Object Detection Using SSD Algorithm: The project utilizes a Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) algorithm to analyze input images. SSD is a deep learning-based object detection algorithm that efficiently detects multiple objects within images in real-time.

⦿ Boundary Visualization and Object Counting: After analyzing the input image using the SSD algorithm, the project visualizes the detected objects by drawing bounding boxes around them. Additionally, it counts the number of occurrences for each detected object class, providing valuable insights into the composition of the scene.

⦿ Output Image with Enhanced Visualization: The output image displayed to the user contains visual enhancements such as overlaid bounding boxes around detected objects. This helps users easily identify and understand the locations and types of objects present in the image.

⦿ Zoom Feature for Detailed Analysis: To facilitate detailed analysis of detected objects, the project incorporates a zoom feature. Users can interactively zoom in on specific areas of interest within the image, enabling closer examination of objects and their boundaries. This enhances the user experience and allows for more comprehensive exploration of the detected scene.
